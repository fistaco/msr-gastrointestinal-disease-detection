# Running the code
Currently, the classifier can simply be run with `python3 classify.py`. The script uses the saved pickle files to retrieve the dataframe. If you want to manually preprocess the data for reproducibility purposes, you'll need to download the kvasir image and feature data sets from https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir/ and put them in a folder named "data".

Also, make sure to install any lacking requirements with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` or simply `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, depending on your system's configuration.

# Report
There currently is no report. The only evaluation is the output obtained from running classify.py. I will likely overwrite this submission with another one to include a report ASAP.
